# 1ID
Fraction Calculator
This command-line program performs operations on fractions. It takes operations on fractions as input and produces a fractional result.

Usage
# Run the `main.py` script with: python3 main.py
    - Enter the operations on fractions as prompted.
    - The program will display the result of the operation.
    - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you type "exit" to quit the program.

# Supported Operations
The program supports the following operations:

    - Multiplication: Use the * operator to multiply fractions.
    - Division: Use the / operator to divide fractions.
    - Addition: Use the + operator to add fractions.
    - Subtraction: Use the - operator to subtract fractions.

# Fraction Formats
The program accepts fractions in the following formats:

    - Whole numbers: Enter a whole number as a simple integer, e.g., 5.
    - Proper fractions: Enter a fraction in the form numerator/denominator, e.g., 3/4.
    - Mixed numbers: Enter a mixed number in the form whole&numerator/denominator, e.g., 1&3/4.
    - Example Runs

# Here are some examples of valid inputs and their corresponding outputs:

    - 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8
    - 2&3/8 + 9/8 = 3&1/2
    - 1&3/4 - 2 = -1/4

# Possible Improvements
Given more time, the following improvements or features could be implemented:

- Additional Operations: Extend the program to support more advanced operations, such as exponentiation or square root of fractions.
- Decimal Output: Provide an option to display the result as a decimal approximation in addition to the fractional form.
- History and Memory: Add a memory feature to store previous results or a history of operations for reference and retrieval.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a graphical user interface for the fraction calculator to enhance user experience and ease of use.
